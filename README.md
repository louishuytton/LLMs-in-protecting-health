# LLMs-in-protecting-health

I started thinking and asked myself, 'How can LLM models be used to protect health, especially now that global warming is becoming more severe and widespread?'

Therefore, I explored and researched various methods to address this issue.

In this project, I used ESP8266, Seeed XIAO nRF52840, and LM Studio to host several models that have been published as open-source worldwide. 
The main problem I aim to solve is utilizing large language models to process environmental data (UV index, temperature, and humidity) and provide advice and recommendations on self-protection.
It was a few devices that I used in this project:

Beside that, I have researched a few models that can understand and give answer in Vietnamese.

                          Compare all the Large Language Models that can understand and give answer in Vietnamese.
